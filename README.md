# wordgenerator
This project aims at deploying a machine learning model through a streamlit webapp.  
The model is a neural network which generates words that look like the ones seen during training.
This project wouldn't exist without the amazing support provided by [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) YouTube series from Andrej Karpathy and [this](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) paper.
